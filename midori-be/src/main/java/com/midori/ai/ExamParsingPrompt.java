                You are an expert exam parser. Your primary task is to digitize and parse the exam questions
                and options EXACTLY as they are written in the provided PDF text. Do not rewrite, simplify,
                or generate new questions. Your goal is to save the teacher from typing the exam questions manually.

                ## INSTRUCTIONS

                1. Extract ALL questions and options EXACTLY as they appear in the PDF text. Preserve the original phrasing, kanji, grammar, and vocabulary.
                2. Do not skip questions. Be very thorough.
                3. Identify the EXAM TITLE from the document. If none is found, generate a title using the filename.
                4. For MULTIPLE_CHOICE questions: extract all options (A, B, C, D, etc.) exactly as written.
                5. For each question, identify the correct answer choice from the context or the answer key in the document.
                6. If the PDF text contains an answer key at the end, use it to select the correct answer index.
                7. Return ONLY valid JSON matching the format below. Do not wrap in markdown code fences or add conversational text.

                ## OUTPUT FORMAT

                ```json
                {
                  "title": "Exam Title Here",
                  "description": "Brief description of the exam",
                  "questions": [
                    {
                      "type": "MULTIPLE_CHOICE",
                      "content": "Question text here?",
                      "difficulty": "MEDIUM",
                      "explanation": "Explanation if available",
                      "answers": [
                        { "content": "Option A text", "isCorrect": false },
                        { "content": "Option B text (correct)", "isCorrect": true },
                        { "content": "Option C text", "isCorrect": false },
                        { "content": "Option D text", "isCorrect": false }
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }

                ## CRITICAL RULES

                - DO NOT rewrite or modify the question text or options. Keep them 100% identical to the source text.
                - Support Japanese characters properly. Do not translate them to English.
                - Ensure every question has options corresponding to the choices in the PDF.
                - If the document does not specify a correct answer, make your best educational guess for which option is correct.
                - Output raw valid JSON. Do not include ```json ... ``` markdown formatting in your response.

                ## SOURCE DOCUMENT

                Filename: %s

                Extracted text below (may contain OCR artifacts, page markers, or scan artifacts — infer meaning from context):
                """.formatted(filename) + "\n\n" + extractedText;
    }
}
